# Ports

Before configuring a proxy, you need to bind a port to listen on. You can do this in the "Ports" section.

Taxy supports four types of ports:

- HTTP
- HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)
- TCP
- TCP over TLS

## Resetting a Port

Changing the port configuration does not affect existing connections. Old connections will continue to use the old configuration. To forcibly close existing connections, you can reset the port.

# Proxies

Taxy supports four types of proxies:

- HTTP / HTTPS
- TCP / TCP over TLS

Multiple ports can be bound to a proxy. However, it's not possible to bind TCP / TCP over TLS ports to an HTTP / HTTPS proxy and vice versa.

## HTTP/2

Taxy supports HTTP/2 for HTTP and HTTPS proxies in both upstream and downstream connections. HTTP/2 is automatically negotiated if the client supports it. However, most web browsers will only use HTTP/2 if the connection is over TLS because they have no prior knowledge of the server's support for HTTP/2 without ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).

## WebSocket

Taxy supports WebSocket (and HTTP upgrading) for HTTP and HTTPS proxies. You don't need to do anything special to enable WebSocket support.

# Certificates

## Server Certificates

For TCP over TLS and HTTPS proxy, Taxy requires a server certificate. There are three ways to install a server certificate:

1. Generate a self-signed certificate
2. Import a certificate from a file (PEM format only)
3. Use [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) to automatically provision a certificate

Taxy will automatically search for a certificate from SNI (Server Name Indication) in the TLS client hello message.

## Root Certificates

If your upstream server uses certificates not trusted by the system, you will need to add them to the root certificate store. Taxy automatically trusts all certificates signed by the root certificate, in addition to the system's root certificates.

Also, if you generate a self-signed certificate, Taxy will automatically generate a CA certificate and add it to the root certificate store.

# ACME

Taxy supports automatic certificate provisioning using [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/) (Automatic Certificate Management Environment). ACME is supported by many certificate authorities, such as Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, and Google Trust Services.

Taxy supports ACME v2 with HTTP challenge only. Make sure that TCP port 80 is open and accessible from the internet.

# Configuration Files

Taxy uses TOML files for storing its configuration. The location of these files varies according to the operating system:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/taxy` or `$HOME/.config/taxy`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/taxy`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\taxy\config`

You can override the default location by setting the `TAXY_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable or the `--config-dir` command-line option.

If needed, these files can be edited manually. Note, however, that Taxy does not automatically detect changes made to the configuration files. To ensure any changes take effect, you must restart the server after editing a configuration file.

# WebUI

Taxy includes a built-in WebUI. By default, it is served on localhost:46492. However, you can customize the port using the `TAXY_WEBUI` environment variable or the `--webui` command-line option. If you wish to disable the WebUI, set the `TAXY_NO_WEBUI=1` environment variable or use the `--no-webui` command-line option.

# Logging

Taxy logs to the standard output as its default setting. You can change this behavior by setting the `TAXY_LOG`, `TAXY_ACCESS_LOG` environment variable or using the `--log`, `--access-log` command-line option.

```bash
$ taxy start --log /var/log/taxy.log --access-log /var/log/taxy-access.log
```

If you want to adjust the log level, you can do so by setting the `TAXY_LOG_LEVEL`, `TAXY_ACCESS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable or using the `--log-level`, `--access-log-level` command-line option.
