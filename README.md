## Web UI Demo

Visit https://taxy.onrender.com/. (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)

You can access the REST API documentation on https://taxy.onrender.com/swagger-ui.

## Installation

To build the Taxy binary, ensure that you have the Rust toolchain installed.

Once you have successfully built and started taxy, you can access the admin panel at http://localhost:46492/.

### From crates.io

The package on crates.io contains the WebUI as a static asset, so you don't need to build it yourself.

Install "Taxy" using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install taxy

# Create admin user
taxy add-user admin
password?: ******

# Start server
taxy start
```

### From git

To build the Web UI, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/picoHz/taxy
cd taxy/webui
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
cargo install --path .
```

## Development

To contribute or develop Taxy, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/picoHz/taxy

# Start the server
cd taxy
cargo run

# In a separate terminal, start Vite for the WebUI
cd webui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## FAQ

### Why don't changes to the configuration take effect immediately?

Updating the configuration solely impacts new connections. 
When browsers maintain active TCP streams, subsequent requests will continue to follow the prior configuration.
